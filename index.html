<!-- SAMPLE FORMAT FOR ALL 30 QUESTIONS -->


<div class="qa-box">
<div class="question">1. Who is God?</div>


<div class="story">Life Story: A young shepherd named Daniel once felt alone after losing his father. One night while watching the stars, he whispered, “God, are You real?” A calm peace filled his heart. He later learned that God reveals Himself not through loud signs, but through His presence, guiding us quietly. Daniel’s faith grew, and he found strength to face life’s storms. This reflects how God makes Himself known to anyone who seeks Him sincerely.</div>


<div class="answer">Answer: God is the Creator of the universe, the Alpha and Omega, who made all things and sustains all life.</div>


<div class="bible">Bible Explanation: Genesis 1:1 teaches that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth — meaning everything finds its source in Him.</div>

<div class="answer">Answer: God created humans for relationship, fellowship, and to reflect His image.</div>


<div class="bible">Bible Explanation: Genesis 1:27 reminds us that we are made in God’s image — meaning we carry His nature of love, creativity, and purpose.</div>
